# WAVEBOARD

WAVEBOARD IS AN APPLICATION BASED ON NODE JS AND SOCKET IO.

This app displays a board where both teacher and student can interact. 
The idea for this little project came during lockdown caused by COVID-19.

Thanks to Socket.IO, you can open two different unique browsers and when the teacher will write on the board of the first browser, the student will be able to see in real time what is written or drawn.
It's real time based application and they can even talk with a chat box.
